## Things to do:
- [ ] Allow users to log in with Twitter via Socialite
- [ ] Lots of other stuff

## Videos
Videos of me developing this:

- [Part 1 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsdiwSpSnMI)
- [Part 2 - Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/mattstauffer/v/80264355) (will be deleted 15-30 days after first recording; for some reason this one fails every time I try to export to YouTube :/)
